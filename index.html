        <p>I was born in Cincinnati,OH.  My parents were in the Air Force.  I grew up in a few different states and England.  The places I have lived the most were Cincinnati, Dover, DE and Englad.  Dover, DE known as the "small wonder" was a cool place to grow up.  The pace of life there is slow and there is no sales tax and has beaches.  I have traveled to some Eurepean countries.  I enjoy learning about new technology and riding motorcycles.</p>
        <p>I have a 4yr old son. He is my mom's only grandchild.  Due to this she has moved here to Georgia to be closer to him (not me, i know the truth).  Some of my family has moved to Georgia as well.</p>
